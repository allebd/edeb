                    <p class="lead"> The Federal Ministry of Power, works and Housing consists of 3 major ministries under one officiating minister in the person of Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola(SAN).

               
                    <p class="lead">Here are 5 things he promised to do to turn the fortune of the newly merged ministry around </p>
                    <ul class="lead">
                    <li> “I’m interested in how best to harness the available human resource assets in the ministry and the physical assets.” </li>
                    <li> “All information will assist us as we hit the ground running. We need to do more so as to regain lost time.” </li>
                    <li> “Nigerians are anxiously waiting for result, which in this case, is improved power supply nation-wide.” </li>
                    <li> “Willingness to hit the ground running, we are here to work with you in solving problems on ground as quickly as possible.” </li>
                    <li> “We want information on what has been done, what remains to be done, and what are the future plans. We want to continue from there.” </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="lead">In a bid to achieving these goals, the importance of the Nigerian citizens’ views and perspectives cannot be overemphasized and must be taken into consideration. 
                    The E-deliberation site has been developed to enhance democratic communication between the Nigerian citizens on issues pertaining to the 3 ministries- Works, Power and Housing. We strongly believe that every voice must be heard as a democratic nation. </p>
